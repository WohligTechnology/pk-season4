            title: "15 mistakes to avoid while filing ITR",
            content: "<p>As per a leading Indian newspaper the last date for filing income tax for the year 2017 &ndash; 2018 has now been extended to 31st August 2018. For those of you who have missed the July 31st deadline, this is great news indeed. You can now file your tax before the 31st August to avoid any penalties up to rupees 10 000/- if you fail to adhere to deadlines.</p> <p>If you are someone who is technically savvy and plans to file the tax returns on your own, kindly have a checklist of the common mistakes that one should avoid during this process. We have highlighted 15 points as your checklist.</p> <h5>1) Evading filing your tax returns every year:</h5> <p>Please avoid this mistake, as it could be costly for you in the long run, eventually the long arm of the law will catch up with you. Even if you are not eligible for income tax, you should file your returns as &ldquo;Zero&rdquo;</p> <h5>2) Incorrect ITR Form:</h5> <p>You should be disclosing all income sources, like rent from house if any, annual interest on savings accounts, fixed deposits or any other investments that you may have made. If you choose the wrong ITR form, then the income tax department will tag it as faulty and will return the same to you. The income tax department will provide you with 15 days&rsquo; time to fill in the correct form. The assessing officer may or may not extend the time limit. If you do not revert within the time limit then the officer will tag it as a void return. This is equivalent to not filing tax for the year. And the same penalties will apply as mentioned in point number1. Before filing your returns you need to check your form 26 AS, to verify if your employer has done all the necessary deductions like TDS at their end. If not you will have to get it rectified and then file for returns.</p> <h5>3) Not declaring incomes which are Tax free:</h5> <p>As mentioned above you have to declare all sources of income even if some of the income is tax free. Not reporting these in your returns could attract penalties and actions. You can however claim exemptions and report it under Exempt Income part in the ITR form.</p> <h5>4) Not reporting all your bank accounts:</h5> <p>You may hold multiple bank accounts in your name, like your personal savings, account, joint accounts with your spouse, parents or children, or salary accounts, or current accounts if you have business interests. If the account is dormant then you may not report it. </p> <h5>5) Correction to your tax filing mistakes:</h5> <p>If you discover at a later stage that is after filing the tax returns that you have made a mistake, then as per the income tax laws the department allows you time up to one year to correct the mistakes and file the revised returns. The one year rule came into effect from the year 2017 &ndash; 2018.</p> <h5>6) Submitting false documents:</h5> <p>If you submit documentations which are false for items like rent, house rent allowance (HRA), Leave travel allowance (LTA) in the form of fake tickets, fake insurance receipts for claiming under section 80 C or false mediclaim receipts. It will be considered as a fraud and accordingly you will be penalized under the Indian law for fraud and evasion. 7) Non-disclosure of part time jobs: If you have a part time job or jobs, it is important that you club the income received from these jobs to your income tax returns. Only disclosing salary</p> <h5>8) Unexplained income drop:</h5><p> Income drop can happen due to a number of reasons, for the salaried class this could happen if you have changed jobs and have not reported the income from the previous employer to the new employer. It could happen during global recession, that if you lose your job or have to take a significant cut in the salary. When the income tax department sees a sudden drop in the salary, this is a red flag for them as they would think that you are concealing income. The same would apply to business class, though the very nature of business is at times to have a sudden drop in income. But this might be understood as tax evasion, or concealment.</p> <h5>9) Unusually high refunds:</h5><p> Tax paying persons, who tend to claim an unusually high amount of refunds, will come under the radar of the income tax. The income tax department generally does not like to give out tax refunds, as they expect the tax payer to have correctly filled in the form and submitted all the necessary documents of investments. The tax officers may serve you a notice, and ask you to substantiate your claims in such situations and you need to have all the necessary documents in place.</p> <h5>10) Inflating donations to charity or NGO&rsquo;s:</h5><p> Tax exemptions are allowed if you can furnish receipts and documents for monies submitted to charitable institutions, NGO&rsquo;s or to political organizations. Such donations will fall under scrutiny if the amount shows in very high. If you have also created fake documents to show donations you will be served an income tax notice.</p> <h5>11) Investments for minors:</h5><p> If you have done long term investing for your children who are minors and if there is income generated from these investments on an annual basis then you have to join this income along with your primary income when you are filing income tax returns.</p> <h5>12) Landlord PAN number:</h5><p> Gone are the days when one could submit HRA to the maximum limit, submit the receipts and claim tax exemptions. From now on the income tax departments also wants to know the PAN number of your landlord as if the amount is high then they would like to collect tax from the landlord as well. So ensure that you have your landlord&rsquo;s PAN number. The income tax department can also ask you to provide the registered rent agreement copy to verify the amount of rent claimed.</p> <h5>13) Form 15H and 15G:</h5><p> If you have income which comes under the tax bracket, you are not eligible to fill in form 15H and form 15G. Be aware that this should be filled only if your overall income does not cross the taxable limit imposed.</p> <h5>14) Advance tax and self-assessment tax:</h5><p> You need to disclose to the income tax authorities in advance if you are liable for self-assessment or advance tax and the same should be paid on time.</p> <h5>15) Return signed copy to Income tax department:</h5><p> When the income tax department sends you the ITRV after you have filed the ITR, then you have to sign the copy as an acknowledgement and send it back to the income tax department by ordinary post only and not through courier. This has to be done within 120 days. </p> <p>Please follow the above guidelines, to ensure a smooth process for filing of ITR, so that you do not come under the scrutiny of the income tax department.</p>"

            title: "Tax evasion topics you must avoid",
            content: "<p>The first question that comes to mind is what is tax evasion? Is tax avoidance the same as tax evasion? The answer is a resounding no. Both are different. Tax avoidance at a simplistic level is reducing the tax that you have to pay via various legal laws provided by the government. For salaried class some of the ways to avoid tax are by investing in section 80C and various other sections in order to reduce the tax outgo. For the business class it is by submitting bills and receipts of all expenses incurred like telephone bill, electricity bill etc. Tax avoidance is to find ways and means to reduce your tax liability within the legal ambit of the law. </p> <p>Coming to the main top of tax evasion it basically means not paying taxes which are owed to the government. The intention is to deliberately conceal the various ways and means by which this can be done. It can be practiced by both the salaried as well as the business class.</p> <p>Mentioned below are some of the means that you must completely avoid to evade tax. The prominent means that make it to the top of the list are: <ul><li>Under valuing your income or not disclosing your income or other sources of income</li><li> Evading duty on imported goods (Customs duty)</li> <li>Not disclosing your accumulated wealth (Wealth Tax)</li><li> Forging your balance sheet or finance related statements</li><li> Black money or bribery in the form of cash for services rendered</li><li> Providing the incorrect PAN number or not providing the PAN number</li><li> Not checking the self-assessment documents carefully, In India it is form 26AS before filing the tax returns</li></ul></p> <p>Sometimes salaried individual are under the impression that since tax is deducted by the employer, they do not have to do anything. This is due to lack of knowledge, you have to submit your investment details like post office investment, interest on Fixed Deposits and interest accrued from savings bank account or if you have any other source of income which needs to be clubbed with your salary income. Not having the required knowledge is not an excuse that the income tax department will accept. Hence it is better to gain knowledge or have the taxes filed via a tax accountant who is an expert in the field of finance.</p> <p>If you are caught doing any of the above or the income tax office raises a scrutiny on you, you have to furnish extensive documentation of your finances, like bank statements, credit card statements, for all family members. Once you are served a notice by the income tax department you have to appear before the income tax officer within a specified time period. It is not necessary that you have to appear in person, you may send your chartered accountant (if you have one) to represent your case and who will plead on your behalf.</p> <p> The reasons why you should avoid tax evasions are; it is an illegal activity in India under the Indian penal code. Which means it is a crime to willfully conceal income to evade income tax and you are liable to be fined hefty penalties if you care caught evading tax. The penalties levied could be as high as three times the income, which you may have hidden from scrutiny. For example if the scrutiny finds that you have not declared income to the tune of 1 lakh rupees, you could be charged a penalty up to 3 lakh rupees. In case of extreme cases of non-compliance you could also be served a jail sentence depending up on the gravity of the situation.</p> <p>In closing now that you know the ways and implications of tax evasion, we sincerely hope that you will not evade tax; instead you will avoid tax by being under the legal scope defined by the government and income tax act.</p>"

            id: "education-loan",
            title: "Education loan or student loan for higher studies",
            content: "<p>Now a day&rsquo;s education costs; are going through the roof, fees for learning in a reputed institution is already very high. Hence student loans are gaining popularity as it enables us to obtain higher education when one does not have the required funding upfront.</p><p> When it comes to paying for school fees, college fees or higher studies fees we have multiple finance option. These are Personal loans and student loans. But which is right for your situation?</p><p> Let us analyze some of the reason why it makes sound financial decision to take education loan also known as student loan, instead of personal loan to fund higher studies.</p> <p>Read further to see how personal loans and student loans compare and how education loan is better than personal loan for higher studies:</p><h5> How to utilize the funds</h5><p> While student loan is restricted only for paying school fees or college related expenses or refinance student debts. Personal loan can fill the financial gaps and help you pay for non-college costs. &#160;A personal loan is a type of financing that can be used for personal purpose like to cover travel expenses, paying old debt, credit card expenses, including student fees etc.</p><h5> Interest Rate</h5><p>Rate of Interest for student loan is lesser as compared to personal loans. The rate of interest for education loan usually falls in between 9 % to 24%. Whereas personal loan interest is between 12 % to 24%. Hence before taking any important decision one should need to visit online the marketplace to compare the same.</p> <h5>Eligibility amount</h5><p> Student loan depends upon students need and financial conditions. The amount can fluctuate from rupees fifty thousand to rupees one crore fifty lakhs. For short term loan the amount can be as small as rupees 5000. Personal loan amount is decided and approved based on your income from your salary and other sources if any, and the banks will demand proof of income for the same.</p> <h5>How to apply and what documents are required</h5><p> Student loan is simple to apply, citizen of India are eligible to apply for the loan. The applicant should furnish proof of admittance into a university. The bank requires certain documentation which is mandatory. Some of them are: </p><p>1) Letter of admission from the institution</p><p> 2) The institution fees chart </p><p>3) The students mark sheets and / or degree certificates from the existing institution Loan providers like banks may provide up to hundred percent of the amount required.</p><p> Margins are not required if the amount of the loan taken is up to rupees four lakhs. Indian rules and regulations mandate that 5% of the loan has to be financed by the student themselves; this may vary from bank to bank depending on their policies. Please check with multiple loan providers to arrive at a decision. If you are studying in a foreign country the margin amount on the loan can be as high as 15% of the loan amount that is being requested.</p><p> Personal loan documents differ from bank to bank, but basically you will be required to furnish your salary slips for the past 6 months to 1 year, bank account statements for a period of 6 months to 1 year and other documents like PAN, or Aadhar card. These will again differ from bank to bank.</p><h5> Disbursal Amount</h5><p> Banks will deposit the loan amount for student education, directly into the account of the college or university for you which you have procured admission based on the fee chart that was provided by the institution. Once the personal loan application is accepted, banks or financial institution directly deposit the approved amount into applicant&rsquo;s bank account.</p> <h5>Repayment</h5><p> The student loan needs to be repaid, after the student completes the college education. Some banks or financial institution provide a relaxation period of 6 months to one year, till such time the student secures a job after the completion of studies. During this period the student is exempt from paying the loan amount. This period is also known as a moratorium period. Five to seven years is usually the period of tenure of EMI&rsquo;s (Equated monthly installments) but this can be spread further based on circumstances. Simple interest is calculated by the banks, for the duration of the course on the loan amount. Whereas personal loan, generally repayment starts immediately after the first month from the time the loan is paid out into the account of the borrower. The tenure of the personal loan is fixed at five years and cannot be extended.</p><h5> Tax Benefits</h5><p> While choosing student loan, interest paid is often deductible from your annual taxes. A personal loan comes with virtually no tax benefits.</p> <h5>Conclusion</h5> <p>Given above facts taking a student loan is a better option for higher studies.</p>"

            id: "personal-loan",
            title: "Top-up loan or Personal loan",
            content: "<p>Wondering which loan to apply for? Let us decode the two choices for you. Choosing a loan or rather any kind of loan is an important decision, and having said that, it also should be used as a last resort, if all other avenues are closed. </p> <p>Let us answer some basic questions and then move onto the recommendations.</p> <h5>Who can avail of a Top-up loan?</h5> <p>Any entities who hold a home loan to their names can apply for a Top-up loan. By far this is the most common form of Top-up loan available. However some providers also provide Top-up loans for personal loans as well, but they are generally more expensive and not recommended.</p> <h5>Pros of a Top-up loan</h5><p> The interest is much cheaper as compared to a personal loan, although it will be slightly more than the interest on the existing home loan by approximately 1.5 % to 2 %. Providers generally charge a processing fee for availing a Top-up loan up to 2.5 %. This is still cheaper compared interest charged on personal loans. &#160;A top-up loan is more easily available, as you already have an existing home loan for which documentation has already been done by the lending institution earlier. If your repayment history for the existing loan is good, that is you have not defaulted on any of the EMI&rsquo;s then your chances of getting a Top-up loan become much higher. You can also avail tax benefits by taking a Top-up loan.</p> <h5>Cons of a Top-up loan</h5><p> A Top-up loan can be availed only, if you already have an existing home loan. The money that is disbursed is to be only used for the purpose of constructing property or for renovation of the house that the loan is taken for.</p> <h5>Who can avail of a personal loan?</h5><p>As the name states, an individual entity can apply for a personal loans for various reasons as per his own choice. The basic documents a person needs to furnish at the time of applying a personal loan are minimum last 6 months bank statement of your salary account.</p> <h5>Pros of a Personal loan</h5><p> The monies availed from personal loans can be used for clearing existing debts, investing, for further education, marriage expenses and just about anything that one can think of including renovating the house.</p> <h5>Cons of a Personal loan</h5><p> The interest rates applicable for personal loans are much higher as compared to Top-up loans. A personal loan has a rigorous verification process and is generally more time consuming and difficult to obtain. Also the documentation needs are extensive. As there is no collateral while applying for a personal, loan, banks and institutions will give priority to people with good credit history and rating. They will check your CIBIL score and have the discretion to approve and reject your loan based on your past history. No tax benefits can be availed by taking a personal loan</p> <h5>Joint Personal or joint Top-up loan</h5><p> You can also apply for joint personal or joint Top-up loans, which are an added advantage; if both the applicants are working entities. This increases the potential to get a higher loan as the loan providers consider joint applications as less risky and also the loan providers like banks can always recover the loan from the second entity if either of them defaults.</p> <h5>Recommendations:<h5><p> The choice whether to choose a Top-up loan or personal loan depends on one's needs. If you require the loan where the sole intention is for constructing a house or renovating the house then you should avail the Top-up loan facility provided for the reasons mentioned above. If your intention is any other aspect, then a personal loan will be the way to go.</p> <p>As the clich&eacute; goes, read all subject matter related documents carefully. One cannot stress enough the importance of this point. As different providers will have different terms and conditions, it is best to narrow down your search by doing a thorough research on the terms and conditions of individual loan providers and then identify a provider who meets your check list.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> GST will be applicable on all banking services availed.</p>"

            id: "reason-save",
            title: "6 reasons to start saving from today",
            content: "<p>If you are one of those people who wonder where all the money went as the month end nears, you are not alone. Majority of the people are in this situation. If you are also working and having a regular source of income, but yet have not got any savings to your name then it is high time that you introspect and make a plan to save money. </p> <p>Why you may ask do I need to save? The reasons outlined below should give you an idea why you should start saving as soon as possible. Does not matter what age group you are in, you may be young, you may be in your middle ages, but you have to start somewhere and the sooner the better.</p> <h5>1) Increasing life span due to advancement in medical technologies</h5><p> As medical science makes new breakthroughs in ailments and diseases, the longevity of your life is increasing. Ailments that were considered life threatening decades ago, have now got cures, or prolong your life. If you are salaried, you will be working till the age of 58, maximum 60 if your company allows it. So where will you have monthly income to spend from age 60 onward if you do not have any savings. </p> <h5>2) Economic downturn</h5><p> The economy may undergo a sudden upheaval due to increasing geopolitical situations. In case of a meltdown in economy, you never know you may suddenly lose your job or may be asked to take a salary cut by your employers. If that happens then to maintain your monthly outgoings you need to have contingency plans and savings in place which will help you to tide over during your moment of financial crisis. .</p> <h5>3) Medical Emergency</h5><p> Even if the economy is stable and you are working, you could come across a medical emergency for yourself or for your near and dear ones. If you have planned for it via medi-claim insurance, then good, but you will still have overheads as medi-claims do not cover all the expenses and you still will have to shell out a substantial amount for that. If you do not have medi-claim insurance, then you will be incurring huge medical costs, which you will have to come up with on your own or will have to dig into whatever little savings that you may have and may end up having to borrow money landing yourself in a debt.</p> <h5>4) Education</h5><p> Higher education and college education fees are going through the roof. You may have always wanted to pursue higher education, but for whatever reasons may have had to postpone your plans. Parents too want the best education for their children. Whatever the case may be, you will need ample amount of monies to fund education. Education cost is forever growing, for example, the cost of engineering was rupees 10000/- per annum in the year 1988. Today the cost of can go up to a few lakhs per rupees per annum in an institution of repute. And if you have to get admission to private colleges, then the fees will be even higher. Considering that costs are climbing at a conservative estimate of 6% to 7% year on year, do your calculations now if you are planning for your child&rsquo;s future education. Find out the current costs and then use a calculator to do the calculation.</p> <h5>5) The power of compounding</h5><p> Compounding them say is the eighth wonder of the world. The early you start the more the effect of compounding gets amplified. Let us take a simple example of two people &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo;. Person &ldquo;A&rdquo; is 20 years old and person &ldquo;B&rdquo; is 25 years old. Both start investing the same amount let us say rupees 10000 every year and that the money simply doubles every year for ease of calculation, you can do the math&rsquo;s using an interest percentage between 8 to 12 % depending on how conservative or aggressive your estimates are going to be. The target is to calculate the amount when both of them are 30 years of age. See the table below for calculations</p> <p> <table border='1'> <tr> <td>Age for 'A'</td> <td>Amount for 'A'</td> <td>Age for 'B'</td> <td>Amount for 'B'</td> </tr> <tr> <td>20</td> <td>10000</td> <td>25</td> <td>10000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>21</td> <td>20000</td> <td>26</td> <td>20000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>22</td> <td>40000</td> <td>27</td> <td>40000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>23</td> <td>80000</td> <td>28</td> <td>80000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>24</td> <td>160000</td> <td>29</td> <td>160000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>25</td> <td>320000</td> <td>30</td> <td>3,20,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>26</td> <td>640000</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>27</td> <td>1280000</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>28</td> <td>2560000</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>29</td> <td>5120000</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>30</td> <td>1,02,40,000</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>As you can see from the above table Person &ldquo;A&rdquo; who has started five years earlier than person &ldquo;B&rdquo; makes more than rupees 1 crore till the age of 30, while person &ldquo;B&rdquo; makes just above 3 lakhs by the time he reaches 30 years of age. Hence you will see the power of compounding when you start early.</p> <h5>6) Security, retirement and a stress free life</h5><p> You will need the approximately the same amount of money after your retirement to sustain your current lifestyle. So you need to calculate your current monthly expenses and calculate the monies required per month after taking into account the average rate of inflation up to the age you think you may require money for. If you can invest early, you can make your hard earned money work for you in a way that the interest that you obtain from your investments becomes more or less equal to your monthly outflow. In such a situation, you would have a stress free life, and could take up jobs that give you more satisfaction (maybe lesser pay) or give you the chance to fulfill your dreams, without any help from anyone. So the next time you get a bonus or some extra cash from other sources, think before splurging it all, instead use the above mentioned reasons as guidelines to a healthy and wealthy living.</p>"

The above are just a few major roles that come to mind, but there are countless other small tasks that need to be done on a daily basis. One should be thankful and gratuitous that if you have a spouse who is a housewife, then you really need to start paying her a salary or pocket money as per the above.

It will take some time to get used to making one as it requires discipline which is quite easy to break. But once you see the benefits, you will not be able to do without it. If you know how to use spreadsheets then this task becomes even easier, as you can automate it to some extent. If you are not tech savvy, we still recommend that you maintain a dairy or a note book and pen down your expenses</p> <p>The very first thing that you need to calculate is the net income that you receive monthly. This is the amount of money that you actually get in the hand, after deductions like tax, provident fund etc. Once you have figured out a number that you will get month on month, you use this number as your base for further calculations and for making of the budget.</p> <p>Now that you have a number to work with, the next thing to do is start keeping a tab on your daily expenditure. Jot down everything, no matter how small the amount or how big the amount. This way at the end of the month you will be able to figure out if you are over spending or are able to save money or are just at break even.</p> <p>After you have kept tab on the spending&rsquo;s for about a month, the next thing to do is to start categorizing the line items that you have written. A few examples of categories would be Travel, Food, Salary for maids, School fees (if you have children), and EMI&rsquo;s (if you carry a home loan). Also wrote down any premiums for insurance or medi-claim etc. that you may have to pay. Once you start categorizing from the second month, you can start fine tuning the categorization to suit your requirements. Further categories to the above examples can be, Travel for office, Travel for work, Food for home, Food for entertainment in hotels, or parties, or treats. Keep refining your spends and eventually you will have more clarity on what you are spending your hard earned monies on.</p> <p>After three months of meticulously keeping a tab on the spending&rsquo;s, you are now ready for an analysis of the spending&rsquo;s. You will now be able to figure out between, static spends and flexible spends. Examples of flexible spends can be petrol money, or taxi money which will vary from month to month. Static spends it will be very difficult to try and make cuts upon. Examples of static expenses are your electricity bill, rent, or maintenance bill, etc. Flexible spends can be controlled to a certain extent. You can also take help of your credit card monthly statements as they provide an item wise listing of your spending habits.</p> <p>Now that you have a good amount of clarity on your spending patterns, it&rsquo;s time to define goals. You can break up the goals into two parts, one is short term goals and the other is long term goals. Short term goals horizon can be as small as 6 months up to a year or max two years like, planning a vacation, or planning to buy a car, or to buy household electronic items, like refrigerator, television, washing machine etc. Long term goals can vary anywhere from 5 year onward, depending on your requirements. You could have a goal, to buy a house of your own, or to fund your children&rsquo;s education or marriage. Once you have a list of goals, you need to prioritize them. There are goals that are a must have, and there are goals that are nice to have. Give priority to the former. Remember goals can be flexible too and can be changed or interchanged. Your budget which you have now started tracking will help you in your goal setting. If you find that you are overspending, it would be a good idea to reduce your credit card spending&rsquo;s.</p> <p>The next step is to plan, now that you have your goals and spending metrics in place. You will need to sit back and make adjustments. If you are someone who watches movies in a theatre, then chances are you are also eating outside and traveling in a cab, which add to the expenses. It just might be a good idea to consider, watching a movie at home, which will help you curtail your expenses. This is one of the example and they will vary from individual to individual. Do a thorough analysis of where you can cut costs and then take a firm decision to stick to it.</p> <p>You will now be in a better position to take calls, as to where you need to invest your savings, and towards which goal you will apportion how much money based on the priority and the short term or long term goal. As we mentioned earlier, if after adjusting the variable expenses you still need to save more money, then it&rsquo;s time to take a hard look at your static expenses and see if you can cut some corners somewhere.</p> <p>Now that you have created an expense budget and have learned to maintain it, analyze it and track it regularly, one last thing remains, and that is to ensure, to keep reviewing your expenses budget regularly. While a few components of your budget may be non- negotiable, you should always review, your company may give you a raise, or you may get an unexpected bonus, or your short term goal may have been accomplished and you now need to plan for a new short term goal. Reasons will come and go, but keep reviewing and analyzing continuously.</p>"

            title: "How to set financial goals",
            content: "<p>What are financial goals and how does one go about achieving them? That is a question that most of us have asked at some point in our life. Having a financial goal, will give you a sense of purpose and once you have created it, it will also give you a purpose and a meaning of fulfilment. So without wasting any more time let us try and understand the steps to setting a financial goal. Remember planning is the key and it has to be as detailed as possible. First of all you need to assess the ground reality and calculate how much your current net worth is. This can easily be done, by adding up all the monies that you have in your banks, or mutual funds, or equities or any other savings instruments. You then need to figure out your current debts in form of any loans, or credit card outstanding that you may have. You need to subtract your debts from your savings to arrive at your net worth. Now that you know what your net worth is, the next step is to have a budget for your daily expenses which needs to be monitored regularly, so that you know what savings you have at the end of every month. Before starting out on goal setting, as a general rule, ensure that you have no outstanding debts. You need to have a contingency or emergency fund in place. As a thumb rule set up an emergency fund first, this is usually around 3 to 6 months of your expenses and will give you the comfort in case of any medical emergency or job loss or any other disaster that may occur. If the outstanding on loans or credit card payment are high, then it is recommended that you take care of this first and then move towards a contingency fund. If you have multiple outstanding debts then it is suggested that you evaluate the interest component on each one and calculate which has the highest interest rate and then pay the highest interest rate debt off first, as against an outstanding where the base amount may be higher, but interest is lower. Paying off your outstanding debts should be one of your short term financial goals. The next step is now to jot down your goals, it can be as simple as noting it down on paper or a simple excel spreadsheet. Recommend the latter; as it is easier to put in formulas for calculations. You can start of by dividing the goals into three sections, namely, longer duration goals with a horizon of more than 10 years, mid &ndash; term goals with a view of 5 years to 10 years and short term goals having a duration of anywhere between 1 year to 5 years. You can tweak the numbers to suit your requirements. Once you have identified the range, it is time to come up with specific goals to go under each range. Let us look at some examples for each range to give you an idea to come up with your own set of goals. </p><h5>Short term goals:</h5> <p>If you have always wanted to have a vacation in a foreign country, or you want to furnish your apartment, or plan a treat for your near and dear ones at a fancy restaurant on special occasions.</p><h5> Medium term goals:</h5><p> You may want to purchase a car at the end of give years, or renovate your dwellings completely, you will need to save a substantial amount of money for these activities. </p><h5>Long term goals:</h5><p> These are generally savings for retirement or higher education for your children, or their marriage, you may want to retire early etc. Now that you have a draft of your goals, the next step is to prioritize. Figure out which goals you want to give priority and apportion a higher amount from your savings towards the same. Analyze your cash flow and other outgo like insurance premiums. Do not over insure as the extra money can be allocated towards a goal. Have just enough insurance to cover contingencies. Try and create multiple streams of revenue. Having alternate streams of incomes, is an important financial goal. Adjust your lifestyle so that you are spending less than what you are earning. As a thumb rule try the 30 / 30 / 40 combination for savings from your income. That is 30% of your income savings to be spent for your day to day expenses. 30 % of your income should be allotted for home loans, or other outstanding debts, and 40 % in investments in the form of mutual funds, equities, fixed deposits etc. These percentage numbers can be tweaked to suit your requirements. Over a period of time once your loans and outstanding are paid off, then the 30 % which was allocated towards outstanding, should be reallocated. 10% of the 30% to be added to your day to day expenses which will take it to 40% and 20% of the 30% towards investment which will take it to 60% in investments. It is also advisable to take help from someone who is an expert to aid you in your financial planning and goals. There are a lot of people out there who call themselves financial experts, so do your research, check up on their credentials and past track record and choose wisely. With the above guidance you will have taken your first step towards financial planning for yourself, which in the long term will be beneficial to tackle any obstacles that may arise.</p>"

            id: "retire-early",
            title: "How to retire early from a job",
            content: "<p>In India the age of retirement in pegged at 58 years for most companies, some companies allow their employees an extension up to 2 years, taking the age of retirement to 60 years. All of us at some point of time have had the desire to retire early and have secretly wished to ourselves that one day we will quit from the rat race, but these just remain pipe dreams for majority of the people. There are however a minority, who retire early. How do they do it? It is one of the most difficult tasks to achieve, but not impossible. You need to have a lot of grit and determination and lots of self-control to make it happen. The first thing to do is introspect and figure out an age that you may want to retire at, depending up on what your current age is. If you are young and have just started working then the goal to retire early could be at 45 years of age. The older you are the more aggressive approach is what you will have to consider. Why would one consider retiring early? The obvious answer is the benefits that one can derive. When you retire early, you have ample amount of time at your disposal. You will save your commute time to work, and the work time itself which is a bulk of the time. You can pursue hobbies and interests that you may have had when you were younger, but have had to forgo, due to the responsibilities of earning for you and your family. You can travel, to different places, without having to apply for leaves and waiting for approvals. You can start a second career which is your passion. You can opt for part time work which is productive and fulfilling, or you can take up freelancing to supplement your income after retirement. After you retire early, some of the main challenges that you may have to face are, not having enough funds to live on as per your existing lifestyle and catering to any emergencies. You need to build this in while you do your retirement planning. You may also want to consider your life span as an approximation. If you do retire at 45; which is a number that we are going to use in this article. Then your life expectancy may be 80, 85, and 90. You need to account for your longevity. Let us take a sample and theoretical calculation. Please note you will have to do research on the current status of the numbers and adjust the same accordingly to come up with your own set of numbers. The example below is hypothetical and numbers are an approximate calculation. Let us say person &ldquo;A&rdquo; earns around 1 lakh rupees a month. His necessary expenses per month are 30% which is Rs/- 30,000 per month. So for person &ldquo;A&rdquo; to retire he must be able to produce Rs/- 30000 per month. At a conservative estimate of 7 % interest rate per annum, he will currently require a corpus of Rs/- 52 lakhs to produce Rs 30,000 per month equivalent of today, twenty years from now.  Twenty years from now if you consider inflation at 8% per annum, the corpus required works out to 1.7 crores. This works out to 8.5 lakhs per annum for the next twenty years or approximately investments of Rs 71000 per month. It is indeed a mammoth task to set aside Rs 71000 per month for the average Indian.  So what are the strategies that one could apply in order to achieve this number. Let us know put into place a macro strategy, you can fine tune it suit your retirement goals. </p><h5>Make your hard earned money work for you</h5><p> The route to making your money work for you is by investing it and using the power of compounding work in your favor. While you may allocate some funds towards safe instruments like fixed deposit and government bonds. It is recommended to invest into equity based mutual funds. If you are not financially savvy then engage the services of an expert to guide you. You could invest in aggressive or conservative mutual funds or both, depending on your risk appetite. Even if you do hire an expert, ensure that you monitor and track your investments regularly on your own. </p><h5>Alternative careers to supplement existing to fund early retirement</h5><p> While having a primary job, look out for opportunities in part time career or consultancy to add to the monthly income. This way you will be able to save more and add to the number of Rs 71000/- . </p><h5>Modification to existing lifestyle</h5></p> Discipline is the key, you will have to make major changes to your lifestyle and it will take all your willpower and self-control to ensure that you maintain the necessary only lifestyle. You can categorize your expenses into somethings that are absolutely necessary, somethings which provide you comfort and lastly things which are purely luxury. Once you identify the above it becomes easy to put a number to each of the categories. This will help you in overspending. Build a corpus first for the necessary things and then for the other categories. You can also consider moving cities and relocating to places where the spending is relatively less and more affordable. Cutting out excess spending, and making these small additions will create a huge impact I the long run. The only challenges one must be aware of are the bad habits of needless spending and one&rsquo;s inability to get an alternate revenue stream. These could act as deterrents to limit your ability to attain early retirement. Create a roadmap and stick to it, you may modify it as you go along, but it should not compromise your retirement goals. The goal should be non-negotiable. Once you have a roadmap in place and have made a resolve to stick to it, you will be on your way to financial freedom, once you attain financial freedom you will be on auto pilot toward an early retirement.</p>"

            id: "need-credit-card",
            title: "Do you really need a credit card",
            content: "<p>Let us begin by saying that one should try to avoid getting into a debt, no matter how small or large and especially credit card debts. Credit card debts are the dangerous and can easily spiral out of control if you do not know how to wield your monies wisely. Let us try and analyze, whether we really need to have a credit card in today&rsquo;s digital era. If you do not have a credit card, then it is one less bill to track and pay at the end of every month. It is a must for one to pay off by the due date. If you pay your dues after the due date, the credit card institutions will levy a huge late fee. If you do not pay or pay only the minimum amount due then the interest component charged is on the entire amount and this can range between a minimum of 18% per annum to as high as 36% per annum. This will go on compounding and before you know it, the amount will be so high that you may actually have to apply for a loan to pay off the credit card dues, or declare bankruptcy. Having credit cards, lulls you into a false sense of security and you tend to lose control when you are doing the actual spends. If you are someone who has a monthly budget chalked out, then having a credit card can directly hamper the budget and make you lose control. It&rsquo;s easy to be tempted when there is a sale going on at a mall or if you are just window shopping. Alternatively if you tend to pay cash, the mind will be forced to think about the money that you need to pay from your wallet in physical form and this may help to curb your instinct of buying at the spur of the moment. At times small but multiple purchases throughout the month may add up and put a big dent in your budget. You may be at a restaurant with friends or family and may be tempted to pay the entire bill, you may purchase a souvenir or some fancy small ticket item for the house which you may not really need, or buy something just because it is the latest fashion to do so. If you are not tech savvy, you could fall prey to the numerous credit card scams both online and offline, where scammers, will skim your credit card details and go on a purchasing spree and you will end up footing the bill. It is a myth that you need credit card spending to generate a good credit score. While this may be true to a certain extent, this will only happen if you pay of all your dues on time and in full before the due date. There are other options to creating a good credit score like paying your EMI&rsquo;s of your home loans on time and paying your utility bills like telephone and electricity on time. This too will help you to generate a good credit rating. Another myth is that the rewards that I get from credit card purchases. This again will hold good if you pay off your bills on time, if however you miss a payment then the late fees and interest alone will wipe out any gains that you may receive against the rewards. Also check for any annual fees, which may outweigh the rewards gains. Banks prefer to provide credit cards to almost everyone who is in employment. They make their monies on the people who are defaulters who are a majority. To be debt free is to be free from any tensions. If you do not have a credit card, you will be unable to fall into the credit card trap and be free from any worries, as you will be actually spending on what you need rather than what you want. The difference between need and want is huge, while a need is a must have and one cannot do without it, a want is something that is nice to have but one can do without it. If you arrive at a decision to get rid of your existing card or do without one, then one should plan ahead for any emergencies or contingencies that may arise due to a job loss, or medical situation or any unforeseen circumstances. In such case one must build an emergency fund consisting of minimum of three months to six months to one year in expenses, based on your needs. Credit cards however have their advantages too; you get a credit period of up to 45 days from the date of making a purchase, which means you have time to roll your money. Credit card companies&rsquo; give you cash back offers, wherein a certain amount of cash is given back to you based on the purchase and it differs with every vendor. If you used wisely, you can benefit from the reward points that you get on credit cards. These can be used to redeem gifts or gift vouchers. In case you are making a bulk payment it can be converted to flexi payment in the form of EMI. So if you pay off your complete dues on or before the due date, then credit cards are a hand tool to have. Having said that, debit cards can be substituted in lieu of credit cards. They help you to control your spends as you need to have the amount of money in your account before making the spend. Only in extenuating circumstances where it warrants the use of a credit card for online booking or other avenues where credit card is the only option, one must use a credit card.</p>"

            content: "<p>First of all, let us define what it means when a cheque is dishonored. If person A, issues a cheque to person B and for whatever reason, the bank does not pay the amount to person B, the cheque is considered to be dishonored.</p> <p>The bank will also issue a memo to person A stating the reason for the dishonor. Person A can correct the details as per the memo issued by the bank and then re-submit the cheque within three months from the date it was issued.</p><p> Person A also needs to pay the amount to person B within a period of thirty days from the date of issue, failing which person B can initiate legal proceedings against person B. Section 138 of the negotiable instruments Act, 1881 will be applicable for cases of dishonor of cheque. Violation of this will carry a penalty or a prison sentence up to two years or both.</p> <p>Let us know understand seven reasons as to why the bank may dishonor your cheque.</p> <h5>Bank balance insufficient:</h5><p> This is by far the most common reason for dishonor of cheque. You may inadvertently issue a cheque for the 1st of the month, but for some reason if your salary is delayed then your bank will have insufficient funds due to which the cheque will get dishonored. Always ensure that you have sufficient bank balance before issuing any cheque.</p><h5> Missing out on writing the payee name: </h5><p>While writing cheque in a hurry, you may unintentionally miss out on writing the name of the person you are issuing the cheque to. At times you may write the amount in figures, but forget to write it in words, or the amount in words will not match the amount written in numbers, the banks will then reject the cheque in such instances.</p><h5> Modification of cheque:</h5><p> Once you have written all the details on the cheque, no modification is allowed, you cannot do a re-correction anywhere on the details, or cannot strike out a word and add another one in its place. Even if you overwrite with your pen on a single letter or a digit the cheque will be dishonored. So take your time and have the details before hand with you.</p><h5> Issue date expired:</h5><p> The validity of a cheque is for three months from the date of issue. If for any reason you submit the cheque in the bank after the validity period, the bank will reject the cheque. Always submit the cheque well before the date of expiry.</p><h5> Signature mismatch:</h5><p> This is again one of the collective causes for cheque dishonor. If the signature that you have on the cheque does not match with the signature in the bank records then banks will dishonor the cheque. This could happen for a number of reasons, your signature may have changed over the years and you have forgotten the specimen signature that you had made at the time of opening the account. In such case, resubmit your current signature to the bank for the records to be updated.</p><h5> Stop Payment:</h5><p> This could happen due to a variety of purposes. The person issuing the cheque could have issued a stop payment mandate if there is a loss in the form of theft or cheque is misplaced. The account may have been frozen due to order by government or by the court of law. If for some reason the account is closed by the person issuing the cheque and the cheque is deposited afterward. The bank will decline from making the payment in such cases.</p><h5> Dormant account:</h5><p> Banks can dishonor the cheque issued, if the account is lying dormant or has been inoperative for some time. Now that you know the main causes, ensure that you take care of the above points while writing out a cheque to someone or while depositing a cheque, so that the amount gets cleared seamlessly.</p>"

            id: "rejection-home-loan",
            title: "Reasons for rejection of home loan",
            content: "<p>The moment that you have been waiting is finally upon you. After painstakingly hunting around, you have identified the perfect house, which meets all your requirements. It is in a good locality, with all the amenities that one requires nearby to the house. You joyfully approach a bank or a home loan institution to obtain a loan. After some waiting, you are told that your home loan has been rejected. Your mind goes blank, trying to figure out what went wrong and you see your dream come crashing down on you like a ton of bricks.</p><p>   Let us see some of the pitfalls that one might face for rejection of loans. </p><p>  The most important one being your CIBIL score (Credit Reports and Risk Management Solutions). If you currently have a bad score, then the chances of rejection of not only your home loan but any other loan that you may take will be very high. At times you may have a good credit rating, but still find that the loan is getting rejected. This may be due to your past track record of defaulting on other loans, or missing payments of credit cards and sometimes even not paying of telephone bills are considered. If your income tax filing is also irregular, this too will affect your credit score. The first thing to do is obtain your CIBIL score, analyze it and try and fix it before you proceed to apply for a home loan. Sometimes the credit rating agency may also have made an error which you need to rectify. Credit score is calculated over a period; hence it makes sense to pay all your bills on time and not to default on even the smallest of bills.</p><p>   The prospective builder or his property may not have been approved by the bank. This is slightly tricky as certain builders maybe approved by the bank; however certain projects of the builder have not yet been approved. Or the property may be approved by the bank, but the builder may not yet have been approved by the bank that you have approached to take a loan from. It is also possible that some other bank or institution may have approved both the property and the builder, in which case you will have to do your homework and approach the bank that has approved both the parameters.</p><p>   The sale price is another important factor. If the buyer and the seller have agreed to a price, then it is not necessary that the bank will consider your price. They will have their own methods of evaluation, which is generally based on the ready reckoner for the area where the property is located. The bank will then decide upon a price which they think is fair value of the property and sanction a loan based on that fair value instead of your buy price. If the fair price is higher than your price, you will have no issues, but if the fair value is lesser than your buy price, then the amount of loan sanctioned will be much lesser than your expectation. Please note that this general happens when there is a re-sale of property and especially when the house under consideration is very old. </p><p>  If you have just started your career either as a business person or are an employee, then it will be difficult to get a loan in the first few years, as banks will consider you as a risk, till such time you are well settled and have a proven track record over a few years of having growth. For the salaried class if you if you keep changing jobs frequently, banks will consider the instability of holding onto a job as one of the factor for rejection. Research says that the salaried class holds onto to a job for a minimum of three years to avoid your loan being rejected. Your age too is considered, as banks generally give the tenure as 15 to 20 years, and the more closer you are to your retirement age, the EMI&rsquo;s will be quite high so that one may not be able to afford it.</p><p>   The above are some of the major reasons for banks for rejecting loans. In conclusion, one should start early, keep a clean track record of payments no matter how small they are, this will help to keep ones credit rating high and the chances for rejection will then become low.</p>"

It is good to not worry too much about the future, but that doesn’t mean that you completely ignore your future. You need to understand that there might come a day when you can no longer earn steadily. What will happen if you don’t have a steady source of income? You cannot afford your lifestyle and face a severe money shortage. Imagine, if you retire at the age of 60 years with a bank balance that will serve you for only five years? Well, you need to avoid that and therefore, you need to save! </p> <h5>Mistake#3: No term plan</h5> <p>An <strong>accident</strong> can change everything. No one can foresee an accident or even prevent one. However, the one thing that we can do is plan such that we can reduce our losses from an accident. There are numerous accidents that take place daily and it makes sense to protect yourself from such contingencies than to suffer a huge and unexpected loss. Therefore, it is a good idea to insure your life and the lives of your family members as well. In case of the unavoidable, at least the ones you care for will not suffer. </p> <h5>Mistake#4: Over investing in fixed deposits</h5> <p><strong>Fixed deposit</strong> is a secure investment. You simply need to park your funds in a secured account and it will grow in value over the years. So, what is the problem with this investment? Unlike other investments, fixed deposits don’t outgrow the inflation in the economy. It means that you might think that your <strong>investments</strong> increase but their purchasing power stays the same.</p> <h5>Mistake#5: Incurring too much debt </h5> <p>Investors are usually of two kinds – on who buy things with the money they save and the other who usually makes purchases with their future earnings (loans). The ‘purchase now and pay later’ attitude just increases the <strong>debt</strong> while the income might or might not increase. This is a wrong attitude to go about your expenses. Before you know it, you will be knee deep in debt. </p>"

                content: "<p>The <strong>annual budget</strong> means different things for different people. What does the budget mean for the <strong>middle class</strong> ? <br><br>There are no changes in the <strong>taxation</strong> slab rates. It means that you will pay taxes as usual. Perhaps this is one of the biggest disappointments of the 2018 budget.</p> <ul> <li>The standard <strong>deduction</strong> that you are entitled to is Rs 40,000. It means that you can reduce the taxable income by Rs 40,000 along with any other deductions and benefits available. However, transport allowance and medical reimbursement equivalent to Rs 19,200 and Rs 15,000 are no longer considered as benefits. </li> <li>There is a 10% tax applicable on long-term capital gains on equity without indexation benefits. Up until now, if you sold equity funds or stocks after holding for at least one year, then the profit on such sale was exempt from taxation. However, now you need to pay a tax @10% if the profit is over 1 lakh. </li> <li>The dividends you receive from equity funds and stocks will be taxed at 10%. However, this deduction is made at source and will be deducted by the company. So, the amount of dividend you receive is the remainder after deducting tax.</li> <li>The health and education cess are increased from 3% to 4%. Cess is the additional tax you pay on the income tax. For instance, if your income tax is around Rs 50,000, then the cess you need to pay is Rs 2000.</li> <li><strong>Senior citizens</strong> no longer have to pay tax on interest on all deposits as well as bank interest up to the amount of Rs 50,000. Senior citizens don’t have to worry about any TDS deductions for interests from deposits up to Rs 50,000. The limit is increased from Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000 now. </li> <li>According to the new budget, the deduction for health insurance under section 80c for senior citizens is increased from Rs 30,000 to Rs 50,000. The 2018 budget is quite a boon for senior citizens. </li> <li>According to section 80DDB, all senior citizens are eligible for a tax deduction up to Rs 60,000 and Rs 80,000 for very senior citizens for medical expenses for the treatment of certain critical illnesses. The limit is increased to Rs 1 lakh now</li> <li>The corporate tax for companies with a turnover of less than Rs 250 crores per year is reduced from 30% to 25%.</li> <li>The EPF contribution for new women workers is reduced from 12% to 8%, for the first three years. Apart from this, the government will now have to make a 12% contribution for the same. </li> <li>The <strong>government</strong> will now introduce a health insurance scheme for the weaker sections of the society. According to this scheme, every family will be entitled for health insurance for the sum of Rs 5 lakhs.</li> </ul> <p>The financial budget for the year 2018 is quite different from the previous budgets and is favorable especially for the senior citizens in the country. </p>"

You probably came across restaurants that never mentioned any taxes in their previous bills have started to charge 18% taxes in the name of GST. You might wonder why you must learn about this. Well, fake GST numbers allow the businesses to charge <strong>tax</strong> from the customers even when the business is not registered with the GST department.</p> <p>A common man might think that with the introduction of GST, everything is costlier by 12-18%. However, if the <strong>business</strong> does not register itself with the GST department, all the so-called GST they charge directly goes into their pocket. You no longer have to fall prey to this seemingly vicious scheme. It is quite easy to verify the GST number and you can do so in less than 30 seconds. </p> <p>The GST number consists of 15 characters and it can be broken down into 5 parts. The first two digits show the state code, the next 10 digits show the PAN of the registered business, the 13th digit is the registration number of the business, the 14th digit is ‘Z’ by default and the last digit is the check code. </p> <p>The first step is to check the GST number printed on the bill or the receipt. The business needs to mention their GST number and if it isn’t, then you don’t have to pay the tax. Not just that, but it is illegal to charge GST if the number is not mentioned on the <strong>invoice</strong>. </p> <p>Once you see the GST number, you need to visit the GST website of the <strong>government</strong> and enter the given GST number. Then enter the Captcha as displayed and click on Submit. </p> <p>If the GST number is not fake, then you will see the registered business name on the website and it needs to match the one that’s printed on the invoice. </p> <p>There are some businesses that don’t have a confirmed <strong>registration</strong> number but instead have a provisional GST number. Well, don’t you worry! You can still verify the same. You need to visit the official GST website, then select the option of “verify provisional ID status.” You need to enter the necessary details like the state, ID type, ID number and the verification code. Once you enter the necessary details, you can check if the concerned business does in fact have a provisional GST number or not. </p> <p>A business can have a registered GST number or a provisional GST number.

                content: "<p>File income tax return and earn the 'refund' you rightly deserve.</p> <p>Benjamin Franklin was absolutely right when he said, “In this world nothing is certain, except death and taxes.”</p> <p><strong>Income tax</strong> is a direct tax and it is levied on your personal income. Income tax is the tax that you need to pay on your income or your earnings. In fact, it is one of the most popular taxes and the least understood concept of personal finance. Why do you have to pay income tax? Tax is the source of revenue for the <strong>government</strong> and it helps fund all governmental activities and services for the public. Everyone who earns an income needs to file income tax returns. </p> <p>Evert taxpayer needs to declare their income to the <strong>IT department</strong> at the end of the financial year in the form prescribed by the government. This form is the ITR and it is summarized statement of your incomes in a given time frame. The different forms of income include salaries, pensions, income from business or a profession, other sources like interest and dividends, capital gains, income from house property and the like. The CBDT prescribes seven forms and you can use any of these forms to file your IT returns. The forms are ITR 1, ITR2A, ITR 2, ITR 3, ITR 4S, ITR 4, ITR 5, ITR 6 and ITR 7.</p> <p>There are different benefits of filing <strong>Income Tax Returns</strong>. If you want to take a loan or even apply for a Visa, then you need a proof of income tax return that you file. You don’t need to have taxable income to file IT returns. It helps to build a proof of your finances or your source of income. If your income is less than the taxable limit, but your employer has charged <strong>TDS</strong> (Tax Deducted at Source) or if you earn some income from any part-time consultancy work and the company deducted TDS @ 10%, then you can claim a refund of the TDS hence deducted. You are entitled to this refund, if your income is below the taxable limit. If you want to claim this refund, then you must file your IT returns.</p> <p>The ITR is not only a proof of your income, but it is also a proof that you have duly paid your taxes for the income you earn in any financial year.</p> <p>You need to file ITR in the following cases: </p> <ul> <li>If your gross total income exceeds 2.5 lakhs. </li> <li>The income earned or accrued by an NRI in India. </li> <li>If you want to carry forward any losses incurred like capital losses or business losses. </li> <li>If you want to claim a refund. </li> <li>If TDS is deducted on any income you earn. </li> </ul> <p>Did you know that in a country with a population of more than 1 billion, only 3% are liable to pay their income tax? Tax evasion and the non-filing of Income Tax Returns is illegal (it means that it can be penalized). So, file your income tax returns on time and avoid all the hassle.</p>"

                content: "<p>Health is wealth, but how do you select the perfect health insurance plan?</p> <p>Here are the important factors that you need to consider before you decide to buy any <strong>health insurance. </strong></p> <h5>Claim Process</h5> <p>Claim process is the time that’s necessary for settlement. It is vital that you select an insurance policy with a simple <strong>claim</strong> process and cashless benefit. Look for good customer support service as well.</p> <h5>Waiting Period</h5> <p>The period that you need to wait for before you can apply to claim your insurance for a pre-existing medical condition. Regardless of the insurance company you choose, all policies have a waiting period. You need to select one that doesn’t have a lengthy waiting period. </p> <h5>Lifetime renewal</h5> <p>Policies tend to have different rules regarding renewability. Some are limited up to 60-70 years and others offer lifetime renewability. Always opt for a policy that offers lifetime renewability.</p> <h5>Room rent cap</h5> <p>In case of any <strong>hospitalization</strong>, the insured person is entitled to the room rent payable. So, you need to check the cap on the room rent chargeable. Make sure that the policy will pay for a major or the entire rent of the room.</p> <h5>Claim ratio</h5> <p>There are various instances where an insurance claim is either delayed or even rejected by the insurer company. To avoid such troubles, it is a good idea to do a background check and read about the IRDA ratio for claim settlements. A higher ratio implies that the insurance company is trustworthy. </p> <h5>Hospital networks </h5> <p>Carefully go through the information about cashless hospital networks before you purchase a health insurance policy. In case of a medical emergency, it is helpful if you have the option for cashless settlement. </p> <h5>Maternity benefits </h5> <p>There are only a few insurance policies that offer full maternity benefits. If you are recently married or are starting a family soon, then you must check for maternity benefits the policy offers. The cost of pregnancy is increasing steadily by the day and it is better to be prepared for such an expense. </p> <h5>Sub-limit</h5> <p>The sub limit is the monetary cap that the insurer has for an insurance claim. Sub-limits are applicable to different expenses like the room rent, consultation charges of doctors, ambulance charges and any other medical procedures. Either opt for a policy with a high or no sub-limit.</p> <h5>Pre and post hospitalization </h5> <p>Medical treatments usually require pre and post hospitalization and the same is applicable for medicines. Therefore, it is prudent to opt for a policy that covers pre and post hospitalization expenses. </p> <h5>Coverage for critical illnesses </h5> <p>There are certain illnesses that can lead to permanent disability or even death. A good <strong>health insurance policy</strong> needs to provide for such circumstances. </p> <p>The other things that you need to consider are the sum assured, OPD expenses, dental treatments and no claim bonus. Apart from this, you must also check if the insurance policy is for only the insured individual or if it is a family floater.</p>"

Well, don’t you worry! There are a couple of simple ways in which you can save the tax payable. Yes, all the tips mentioned in this section are legal.</p> <p>80C</p> <p>Section 80C of the Income Tax Act provides different categories of income that are deductible from your income. If you deduct certain incomes, then the tax payable will automatically reduce. Items that are exempt under this section include </p> <ul> <li>Public Provident Fund (PPF),</li> <li>National Savings Certificate (NSC),</li> <li>Principal that you repay on home loan, </li> <li>Life insurance premium</li> <li>Deposits with maturity period of minimum five years in bank and the post office.</li> </ul> <h5>Maturity amount or life insurance claim </h5> <p>The amount that you receive on the maturity or by the claim of a life insurance policy is exempt from taxation. However, the precondition that the annual premium assured on the policy doesn’t exceed 20% of the amount assured. If the premium exceeds 20%, then the entire amount you receive is taxable.</p> <h5>Education scholarship </h5> <p>If you receive an education scholarship either from the government or from a private trust, the same is exempt from taxation. The amount you receive as scholarship money is not to be included in the calculation of total income.</p> <h5>Profits from the sale of equity mutual funds/shares </h5> <p>If you hold any equity mutual funds or shares for one year before you sell it, then any profits that you receive from such a sale is exempt from taxation. Such a sale is a long-term capital gain and it is exempt. You need to wait for a period of more than 365 days (366 in a leap year) if you want to claim this exemption. Any sale made before the completion of one year is taxable.</p> <h5>Dividend on equity mutual funds or shares </h5> <p>If you receive any periodical dividends from equity mutual funds or shares, then such a dividend is exempt from taxation. For instance, if you purchase stock and receive a dividend of Rs 30,000 within a period of 10 months, it will still be exempt.</p> <h5>Any gift received on marriage </h5> <p>The gifts you receive on marriage are not taxable. However, this exemption is a one-time benefit. So, any monetary gift (cash or cheque) that you receive on occasion of marriage is not to be included in the calculation of total income. </p> <h5>Interest on savings account</h5> <p>The interest that you receive from your savings account is exempt from taxation up to the amount of Rs 10,000. If the interest you receive is more than Rs 10,000, then the rest will be taxable.</p> <h5>Medical insurance </h5> <p>Any medical insurance claim you receive up to the amount of Rs 15,000 on an insurance policy for self, spouse or dependent children is exempt from taxation. </p> <h5>Any charity </h5> <p>The provisions of 80G specify that any money given, as charity is exempt from the provisions of taxation. </p>"

                content: "<p>A higher <strong>credit card limit</strong> is not just a status symbol, but something that is quite useful. </p> <p>What exactly does a credit limit mean? As the name suggests, it is the maximum sum of <strong>money</strong> that you can <strong>borrow</strong> from a bank on a given credit card. You can use the credit limit to make any purchases like you normally do. The only difference is that, instead of drawing your funds from your savings account, you create a debt account with your bank. The bank will keep a track of your transactions and will accordingly revise your credit limit based on your transactional history and repayment capacity. </p> <p>There are different parameters that a bank uses to decide the credit limit for individual <strong>credit card applicants</strong>. These criteria include income, credit score and monthly <strong>salary</strong> of a person. According to their credit policy, then bank will decide the credit limit after scrutinizing all these criteria. Don’t fret if the bank offers you a low credit limit. Banks usually revise the credit limit within a period of six to eighteen months, according to the financials and the repayment record. If you pay your bills on time and improve your financial health, then the bank will increase your credit limit as well.</p> <h5>Benefits of a higher credit limit </h5> <p>A major advantage of a <strong>high credit limit</strong> on your credit card is that you can reduce your credit utilization ration, provided you use it judiciously. A lower credit utilization ratio will improve your credit score. For instance, if the credit limit on your card is Rs 50,0000 and you use Rs 25,000 a month, then your credit utilization ratio is 50%. Now, if the credit limit is increased to Rs 75,000 and you spend Rs 25,000 a month, then your credit utilization ratio is 33%. It means that your credit score will improve. </p> <p>If you want to obtain a loan with a bank, then you can use your credit limit to get a better deal for yourself. Banks are prudent when they offer higher credit limits to their customers. If a bank issues a higher credit limit, it means that the bank considers the said individual to be a safe asset. </p> <p>It is always better to have one high-limit credit card than to have different credit cards with lower limits. If it is just one card, then you simply need to track the expenses made with the concerned card and don’t have to worry about keeping a track of different expenses made on different cards. </p> <p>In the face of a financial emergency, a high credit limit certainly comes in handy. You can use the same to obtain loans for self, family members or even friends. You can even obtain personal loans if you have a high credit limit. </p> <p>Another benefit of a high credit limit are all the rewards that you are entitled to on the transactions you make.</p>"

Follow the easy steps mentioned in this post to make the process of <strong>buying a house</strong> simpler. </p> <h5>1) Monthly household expenditure</h5> <p>For any middle-class household in India, buying a house is a major <strong>financial expenditure</strong>. Given that the real estate prices are on a steady incline, it is not possible to buy any property without some financial stretch. If you want to borrow money to purchase a house, then you must cut down on your monthly household expenditure between 25 to 40%. </p> <h5>2) Loan amount </h5> <p>At present, banks provide house loans worth 80% of the value of the property. If you want to borrow from a bank, then you need to be able to fund the remaining 20% on your own. This amount must not be raised through another loan or debt. Ideally, it is advisable that you contribute at least 40% of the down payment from your savings to reduce a financial strain. </p> <h5>3) Liabilities</h5> <p>It is important that you make a list of all the liabilities that you might face in the next six months. Liabilities can include tuition fee, insurance premium and so on. Ensure that you have sufficient funds to fulfill all these liabilities. </p> <h5>4) Existing loans or debts</h5> <p>You need to clear all the <strong>exiting loans</strong> or debts that you might have before you apply for a housing loan. It is highly unlikely that you will be able to pay off two loans simultaneously. You need to clear all the unsecured loans you might have to improve your CBIL score.</p> <h5>5) EMI reserve</h5> <p>It might be a small amount, but it is important that you set aside the amount necessary to pay off the EMIs on the loan for the next three months. The EMI reserve will come in handy in case of any unforeseeable circumstances that might lead to the non-payment of the EMI.</p> <h5>6) Budget</h5> <p>Most people tend to go a little overboard when furnishing and designing their house. Home furnishings or interiors are a major expense and you must fix a budget for the same.</p> <h5>7) Regular source of income </h5> <p>Financial planning is not possible if you don’t have a steady income. If you work in a sector that is susceptible to recession or any other economic conditions, then you might want to postpone the decision to purchase a house until you have a steady and regular income. </p> <h5>8) Emergency fund</h5> <p>Life is quite uncertain, and it is not humanly possible to foresee all expenditures that you can incur. There can be a contingency and you must not be caught unaware. You need to prepare for all sorts of emergencies. The best way to prepare for an emergency is to set aside an emergency fund. When you calculate your ability to repay a loan, take the contribution to the emergency fund into account as well. </p>"
